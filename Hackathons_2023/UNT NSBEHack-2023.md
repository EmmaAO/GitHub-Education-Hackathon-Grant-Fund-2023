## Event Summary

The fourth annual UNT NSBEHack was a 24-hour event that was open to all majors and students all across Texas. We provided students with an opportunity to showcase their technical skills, present their talents, and expand their social and professional networks. 
The event featured three distinct challenges: a software challenge, a product design challenge, and a presentation challenge, ensuring a diverse and engaging experience for all participants. 
Our sponsors, Peterbilt, MLH, Carbon 6 and CoreLogic hosted workshops and did presentations to give the participants the chance to learn about their company and learn about internship opportunities.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
GitHub Grant helped us run a smooth and successful hackathon. We were able to accommodate the needs of everyone and reach out to a larger audience to be more inclusive.
The prizes helped keep our participants motivated and encouraged throughout the event.

## Top Projects

UNT NSBE created some amazing projects for participants to work. All the teams collaborate with GitHub, which help make their projects successful.
Here are some of the projects:

ChooseUrBot and AidBot:

Made AI chatbots focused on mental health and Halloween themes, in Google Cloud and Taipy respectively.

OpenAI:

The chatbot uses OpenAI algorithms to understand the student's learning preferences and needs. It then provides personalized recommendations for educational resources and provides answer based o the prompt given by the developers.

Charripm: 

We strived to create a machine learning application that makes generative AI easily accessible, enjoyable, and educational for everyone. CharRIPM motivates users to engage in the act of unique prompting to have fun and become familiar with artificial intelligence as a whole.
